## How it was made.
### Resources:
I used a combination of resources to put this project together, first and foremost was learnonline. The main criterea we had to hit in order to get a basic pass grade in this project was all well documented in our notes, along with clear examples of how to impliment them into our lab work, and later to the project. - https://learnonline.gmit.ie/course/view.php?id=4195 . After that however, it was mainly up to us to add whatever functionality we wanted in our project. I knew from an early stage in this module that I was going to try to use a public API in this project as it was something I have never used before, but knew it would be an important skill to posess. I started scouring the internet for apis such as weather apis or transport apis, but I found them to be quite boring and unimaginative. I decided I was going to use a news API for pulling data into my project because of its scalability, and its ability to incompass some of the more basic apis available to the public. In the end I used - https://newsapi.org/ . I used this API as it was extremely well documented with step by step instructions of how to use it and because of the fact that is is very dynamic. Any problems I had concerning uwp was dealt with by referring to the microsoft documentation for xaml and uwp - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.documents . Any other problems I was having after that was dealt with by referring to stackoverflow as any problems I was having, other developers experienced similar issues and had them solved. - https://stackoverflow.com/ .
